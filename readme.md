# ✨ Proactive Wellness App

Tired of feeling drained after long hours at your desk? 😴  
**Proactive Wellness** is your AI-powered desktop companion, designed to boost your productivity and safeguard your mental and physical well-being — in real time!

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 👁️ Real-Time Wellness Monitoring
- **Computer Vision (via Webcam)**:
  - Eye gaze tracking
  - Facial emotion detection
  - Posture analysis
  - Screen distance detection
  - Ambient lighting check
- **Activity Monitoring**:
  - Mouse movement (Pixels Per Second - PPS)
  - Keyboard typing speed (Words Per Minute - WPM)
- **Simulated Metrics**:
  - Heart rate (simulated)
  - Hydration level (manual + auto-detection)

### 🧠 AI-Powered Fatigue Prediction
- Trained ML model (via scikit-learn) predicts fatigue score from all real-time inputs.

### 💡 Smart Recommendation System
- Personalized suggestions like:
  - “Take a break!”
  - “Adjust your posture!”
  - “Time to hydrate!”
- Optional “Dismiss for a While” to mute suggestions.
- Cheer-up jokes included when you're feeling low! 😄

### ⏱️ Wellness Tools
- 🥤 **Water Tracker** – Manual logging + auto-detect drinking
- 💤 **Nap Timer** – Set custom timers for quick rest
- 🏃 **Exercise Break Timer** – Short breaks to fight inactivity

### 🌈 Dynamic UI Feedback
- React frontend UI changes color based on wellness/fatigue levels for instant visual alerts.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔙 Python Flask Backend (`/backend`)
- **Handles all AI logic & monitoring**
- Uses:
  - `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe` – webcam-based tracking
  - `FER` – facial emotion recognition
  - `pynput` – mouse/keyboard monitoring
  - `joblib` – for loading fatigue ML model
- Exposes a REST API at `/predict_wellness`
- Multi-threaded design ensures responsiveness

### 🔜 React Frontend (`/frontend`)
- Built with **React + Tailwind CSS**
- Fetches backend data every few seconds
- Displays metrics + gives smart recommendations
- Features timers, water tracker, and animations

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm or yarn

---

### 🐍 Backend Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akashprajapaticse/Proactive-Wellness.git
cd Proactive-Wellness/backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Activate it:
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

#### Generate the ML Model:

```bash
python generate_and_train_fatigue_model.py
```

#### Run the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

> 🖥 A webcam window will pop up — press `Q` to quit.

---

### ⚛️ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install      # or yarn install
npm start        # or yarn start
```

> 🌐 App will auto-launch at `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 🎮 Using the App

1. **Run both backend and frontend**
2. Open browser at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Click **"Start Working Time"** to begin monitoring
4. Watch your live metrics and follow the suggestions!
5. Use nap/exercise/water timers as needed
6. Press `Q` in the OpenCV window to stop
